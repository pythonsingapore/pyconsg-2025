        <p class="mb-0">The logo for PyConSG 2025 was inspired by <i>Monty Python Flying Circus</i>, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. The creator of the Python language, Guido van Rossum, was a fan of the show and chose "Python" because he wanted a name that was "short, unique, and slightly mysterious". (source: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python" target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python</a>)</p>
        <p class="mb-0">We decided to adopt the iconic foot from the <a href="https://youtu.be/vL6ton0Dbz4" target="_blank">main theme</a> of the comedy, and infused elements of Python, technology and Singapore into the logo as well.</p>
        <p>We hope that this year's logo brings you a fresh perspective on Pythonâ€”beyond it being just your favourite programming language or a snake! :)</p>
