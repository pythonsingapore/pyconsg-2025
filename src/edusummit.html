                      Data structures and algorithms are foundational topics in any computer science curriculum, yet students often find them abstract and challenging. To address this, together with my student Lim Jia Earn, we have developed a learner-centric platform, MyCodeWeapon, which integrates generative AI - including LLM agents and AI copilots for code - to support scalable, personalized learning.

The National Olympiad in Informatics is a competitve programming contest which focuses on data structures and algorithms (and which NUS typically recommends C++). We have provided problem sets involving computational thinking and Python coding to improve accessibility to Computing students/learners which typically learn Python in schools.

                      Generative AI has sparked a discussion on whether we still need to learn coding. One of the purpose of learning coding is to enhance problem solving skills and thinking. Novice programmers need help in their problem solving skills and PCDIT framework helps novice programmers to navigate the various barriers in problem solving through concrete steps. In this talk, we will share the experience of designing and deploying PCDIT chatbot which is meant to facilitate students in their problem solving when doing programming problems.

                      Often students are expected to pick up basic problem-solving skills by inferring strategies from solving stereotypical problems e.g. determining if an integer is a prime number, finding the sum of a series, finding the maximum in a list etc. <br>
                      However, some researchers have argued that it might be helpful to teach students the common patterns used in problem solving, termed by Soloway as "Goals and Plans", so that students have a better knowledge base to solve more difficult problems. In this talk I discuss some research studies that talk about patterns and the difficulties novice learners have with them. Then I will describe SUTD's experience on teaching patterns and reflect on how we can do better based on the insights from these studies.

                      We run quarterly workshops for beginners with no prior coding experience or knowledge of the Python Language. Using the Raspberry Pi Pico as a platform to teach, we endeavour to make learning to code in Python easy to grasp and enjoyable.<br>Participants are taught to build simple circuits using components such as buttons, LEDs, buzzers and bring these circuits to life using Python code. This interactive method provides immediate visual feedback. We also demonstrate that the pieces of knowledge gained can to put together to solve real-world problems like a pedestrian crossing/traffic light system or a burglar alarm system.<br>In our recent sessions, we have included an AI segment, where participants are introduced to tools like ChatGPT. We showed them how AI tools can be used, not only to assist them with writing, explaining, and debugging code, they can also use them to further their Python learning journey on their own.

                    <p>Norman currently teaches programming at SUTD, teaching mainly first-year programming courses in Python and Java.</p>
                    <p>With a passion for teaching, he is interested in how classroom response questions can be used to teach programming concepts effectively and overcome student misconceptions. He is interested in the various issues related to teaching and learning in computing and higher education, including but not limited to assessment practices and learning design. He is also interested in learning analytics, especially in investigating the insights that can be gained by applying data-mining techniques to student data.</p>
                    <p>Prior to joining SUTD, he spent the past nine years teaching in the local polytechnic sector. In that time, he taught mainly mathematics and physics but also had opportunities to teach C++ programming, introductory data mining and mechanics of materials. He had taught at various levels, from diploma students to adult learners. He was also an adjunct lecturer with the Singapore Institute of Technology. He is familiar with pedagogies such as problem-based learning, peer instruction and the flipped classroom.</p>
                    <p>He completed a PhD in computational materials science at the National University of Singapore in 2010, employing software tools to investigate the mechanical properties of Sn-based intermetallic compounds using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation.</p>

                    <p>My name is Goh Soon Seng. Most people called me SS or Mr Goh.</p>
                    <p>I am 72 years old this year, retired.</p>
                    <p>Before my retirement in 2020, I worked as a software engineer. I specialised in building freight and cargo management systems for the logistics industry. After my retirement I volunteered with NLB Learnx to set up LearnX - Pi Python. It has two components: 1 ‚Äì The Pi Pico Makers Club and 2. The Pi Python Course for the Community which I will be sharing with you during the summit.</p>
