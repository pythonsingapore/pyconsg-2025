                      Data structures and algorithms are foundational topics in any computer science curriculum, yet students often find them abstract and challenging. To address this, together with my student Lim Jia Earn, we have developed a learner-centric platform, MyCodeWeapon, which integrates generative AI - including LLM agents and AI copilots for code - to support scalable, personalized learning.

How did its mainstream high schools lay a firm foundation in informatics (computer science) and AI literacy? We explore this from a high school computing teacher's perspective.

                      Bebras is the international benchmark for computational thinking and informatics, which does not involve programming. The National Olympiad in Informatics is a competitve programming contest which focuses on data structures and algorithms (and which NUS typically recommends C++). We have provided problem sets involving computational thinking and Python coding to improve accessibility to Computing students/learners which typically learn Python in schools.

                      Students often face difficulties navigating vast resources with little personalised support. The AI-based solution combines large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems to deliver tailored educational and career advisory. The system's Tutor Section offers progressive teaching, contextual Q&A, and personalised review; its Career Advisory Section handles interview questions, skill gaps, cover letters, and resource recommendations.

                      We run quarterly workshops for beginners with no prior coding experience or knowledge of the Python Language. Using the Raspberry Pi Pico as a platform to teach, we endeavour to make learning to code in Python easy to grasp and enjoyable.<br>Participants are taught to build simple circuits using components such as buttons, LEDs, buzzers and bring these circuits to life using Python code. This interactive method provides immediate visual feedback. We also demonstrate that the pieces of knowledge gained can to put together to solve real-world problems like a pedestrian crossing/traffic light system or a burglar alarm system.<br>In our recent sessions, we have included an AI segment, where participants are introduced to tools like ChatGPT. We showed them how AI tools can be used, not only to assist them with writing, explaining, and debugging code, they can also use them to further their Python learning journey on their own.
